The code is composed of 3 files: 
faculty_vs_students.cpp, faculty_vs_students.h, faculty_vs_students_constants.h
All 3 should be open to be able to run the code.
In order to simulate different scenarios, one need to modify some values (that play the role of inputs) in "faculty_vs_students_constants.h" and "faculty_vs_students.cpp".
The current uploaded version is the base case scenario, under low compliance (50%), low initial vaccine coverage (30%) and high vaccination rate (120 vaccines/day).
